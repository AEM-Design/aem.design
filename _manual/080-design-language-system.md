## Introduction

A design language system is a collection of design principles and components that unite product teams around a common visual language.

* **Design** is the description of visual aesthetics that are inferred from Brand Guidelines.  

* **Language** is the common dictionary of terms that describe the design elements and design options that apply to components components

  * **Design Elements** refers to general design conventions that can be applied across all components and govern general component behaviour

  * **Design Options** refers to a subset of design conventions that apply to specific components

* **System** is the definition of components and their behaviour and their relations with Design and Language.

The DLS can be considered the source of truth for how elements look and behave.

* Designers, developers and content authors can use the DLS to check if an element of design already exists.

* Content authors can use the DLS for instructions on how to use certain design components.

Like a natural language, the DLS is supposed to grow over time as components are progressively added to it

Design Language systems are aimed to be a shared Language for understanding design, that transparently leads to understanding implementation. Following definitions are made to ensure discrete understanding terms that are used  

Design Language is a vocabulary that is used to describe the design.

Design Language System is a reference implementation of a Design Language.
