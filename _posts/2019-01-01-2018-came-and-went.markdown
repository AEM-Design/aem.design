So 1 Year on on since what has changed:

- "so many repos" are now 4 and parent! This means quicker releases, everything has been compacted along functional need
- its all about automation testing, selenium hub grid is used for local and pipeline builds
- refactoring, refactoring, refactoring shredding all the old and adding cleaner ways of doing things
- create a simple way to allow authors to select renditions per media query (view port / breakpoint) on components
- integrated analytics DataLayer industry standard into templates
- create new way of creating tag content when translating CSS into authors language
- created a new prototype that uses (https://patternlab.io)[https://patternlab.io] as a base to demo your cool work
- released all of the docker containers to Docker Hub (https://hub.docker.com/u/aemdesign/)[https://hub.docker.com/u/aemdesign/] with pipelines straight from gitlab
- created tenant archetype that allow quickstart for tenants projects, that has tenant naming thought out including component groups and has all the tests ready to go
