Introduction
===

After the first hit to the page in aem and HTML response received for first time from publish instance will get cached on Akamai level.

Subsequent request to the same page will be served from the cached content in Akamai rather than hitting dispatcher / publisher. 

Anytime did you struggled to get the latest HTML from publisher instead of Akamai cache? 

***Well we did!!!***

What we have done
===

We have worked on AEM replication agent for flushing Akamai cache whenever page gets published. 

So, after author change a page content and publish it our Akamai cache flush agent will pick that page and request to akamai for clearing cache. 
So that user of that page will get the latest content instead of cached old content from Akamai.

It is all automated, we don't need to clear the Akamai cache when new product goes live to prod. 

We don't ask DevOps to clear Akamai cache so customers will see latest page. Lets save their 1-2 mins time whenever new product launch.


What are all details do you need to setup flush agent 
===

            1.  akamaiDomain
            2.  akamaiBaseUrl 
            3.  akamaiPurgeUrlPath
            4.  clientToken
            5.  clientAccessToken
            6.  clientSecret

If you think you don't know these info's or not sure from where you can get it? Ask devOps these information and say I got your back if you provide me these info :)


How we are managing the secrets
===

After getting the information from you, we are encrypting data and storing it on AEM so you are safe with your secrets.

How to configure Akamai flush agent on your AEM Author instance

This component will save our time whenever we need to update the content in AEM pages. 

Make sure you have set up the dispatcher flush agent as well so we can avoid content served from Dispatcher cache.
