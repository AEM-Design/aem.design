Quick update to showcase upcoming automated tests results using Github Pages.

On previous occasions the only way to show off how automation test suite result should look was to show some screenshots similar to this: 

![Automation Test Summary](/assets/images/automation-testing/summary-all.png)
![Automation Test Summary - Errors Only](/assets/images/automation-testing/summary-errorsonly.png)

![Automation Test Spec](/assets/images/automation-testing/spec.png)
![Automation Test Spec - Expanded](/assets/images/automation-testing/spec-expanded.png)

From now on the results will be published to github pages to provide an experience you should be having with your automate test suites.

You can view the output from test suite on github.
