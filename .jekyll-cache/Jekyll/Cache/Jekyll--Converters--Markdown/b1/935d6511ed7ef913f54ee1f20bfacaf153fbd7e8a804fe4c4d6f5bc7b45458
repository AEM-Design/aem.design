I"A<p>The time has come to migrate to Sightly. Primary drive is that Sling Models are great and Sightly now works (long story…). 
Secondary drive is that it provides absolute templating without opportunity to embed code with template code. 
Using JSP and JSTL work great, but it does not provide strict no “Code in Templates” governance.
So if you are not careful you could end up with code plaguing your template and that would break your conventions.
This has worked great over the years but as framework usage grows simpler oversight is required to ensure stability.</p>
