I"U<p>Itâ€™s always great to head into the end of the year with a good milestone.</p>

<p>Last week migration to Touch UI has been completed!</p>

<p>You can now manage all of the template and create new templates with ease using OOTB template authoring tool available in AEM 6.3+!</p>

<p>As always all dialogs have the common configuration features that allow complete control of styling for all components.</p>

<p>This has been a great outcome which was long coming and its further complimented by awesome features in AEM TouchUI!</p>

<p>Looking forward to testing further in AEM 6.4 Beta!!</p>
