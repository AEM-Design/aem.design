I"<p>Having trouble working with the theme? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues">fixing a bug</a>? Then by all means <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new">submit an issue</a> or <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">pull request</a>. If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a> first.</p>

<p>Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site’s unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it’s not something that most people will use, I probably won’t consider it. When in doubt ask.</p>

<p>This goes for author sidebar links and “share button” additions – I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.</p>

<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull Requests</h2>

<p>To help out try to avoid creating pull requests on <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> and instead branch off of <code class="highlighter-rouge">develop</code>. It’s much easier to test, merge, and roll them into new releases this way.</p>

<p>Theme documentation and demo pages can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aem-design/aem.design/blob/master/docs"><code class="highlighter-rouge">/docs</code></a> if submitting improvements, typo corrections, etc.</p>
