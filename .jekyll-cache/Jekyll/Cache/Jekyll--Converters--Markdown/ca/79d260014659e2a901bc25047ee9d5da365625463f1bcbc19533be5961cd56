I".<p>AEM.Design is about giving you a starting point of your project but by your future self.</p>

<p>Its about starting with AEM at a point in your journey after you have learned what AEM is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>After you have realised that authors actually should build your experience.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have mastered the deployment cycles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have learned what type of testing gives you best outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have been trough the “Works on My Machine” certification program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have learned what happens to your servers if everyone users the console.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After you have tried to standardise your environments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all that and much much more learning your future self built a project base for you to start doing things without repeating them, much…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The aim is to present a design that is scaled from the get go.</p>

<p>A design that integrated best practices and enables you to concentrate on things that matter to your customers.</p>

<p>So if you are tired of spending countless hours on blog’s, micro-sites and arguing with arrogant forum admins, without getting a full picture.</p>
