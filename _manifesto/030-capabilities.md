## Tags

[Tags](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/cq/current/wcm/tag_admin.html) must be used to classify content within CMS. Tags structured in namespaces provide a flexible and extendable layer when designing [metadata](http://docs.adobe.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/content/assets/metadata.html) for assets and content. The OOB components associated with Tags provide simple and effective authoring experience and should be used to drive Authoring Experience where Lists and Arbitrary Structures are required on dialogs. Management of Tags in AEM allows ability for the Business users to extend their content experience without needing to update code.

## Scaffolding

[Scaffolding](http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/wcm/scaffolding.html) should be used to streamline authoring experience of particular pages. It should be used to create authoring experiences for creating and updating content. A scaffold is a dialog, that is made up of limited fields that are tailored for that particular authoring experience requirements.

## Digital Asset Management

The term [Assets](https://dev.day.com/docs/en/aem/6-0/administer/content/assets.html) in AEM also know as DAM in short refers to the Digital Asset Management capability. Its primary use is to share and distribute assets within an organisation. As DAM is integrated into AEM platform the images from DAM can seamlessly used in the Authoring experience.

### Asset Metadata

Asset Metadata is additional data for the image, it enriches user experience as the information for the image is stored with the image and can be reused by component in places where its appropriate. For example a metadata description field if entered would appear in an Image component to convey additional information to the viewer.
